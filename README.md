</br>It works with Blender 2.8 and earlier versions

# How it works
Working on object packs for Unreal Engine 4 can be tedious with Blender. That's why I created the Add-on: "Blender for UnrealEngine". It simplifies the method of exporting from Blender to Unreal Engine 4 by allowing you to export all the assets of a scene at the same time. It even automatically distributes them in a proper tree structure in correlation with the Unreal Engine 4 pipeline!

Sockets and collision shapes are created directly in Blender.
You can precisely choose which animations need to be exported.
It includes a error checker to prevent potential problems and generate python scripts that can be used in Unreal Engine 4 to import the Camera Objects and Animations from your Blender project to a Level Sequence in Unreal Engine 4. All Camera Objects and their animations will import as Camera Actors.
